# Cardiovascular Disease Report

This project is inspired by my year 2 university project proposal titled **“The effectiveness of docosahexaenoic acid at reducing inflammation in patients with cardiovascular disease”**. I downloaded the dataset off of [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alphiree/cardiovascular-diseases-risk-prediction-dataset). The data has already been cleaned and processed, however, I wanted to use SQL and Tableau to create a dashboard of data figures.
